# ðŸ“Š US Traffic Accident Data Analysis

## Overview  
This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a real-world US traffic accident dataset to uncover trends and patterns in accident frequency, timing, weather influence, and geographical hotspots. The aim is to visualize how different factors contribute to road accidents in the US using data visualization techniques.

## Dataset  
The dataset contains detailed records of traffic accidents in the United States, labeled by:
- **ID**
- **Severity**
- **Start Time**
- **City**
- **Temperature**
- **Weather Condition**
- **Location (Latitude, Longitude)**

The data was preprocessed, cleaned, and visualized to discover accident-prone regions, common accident times, weather conditions, and more.

## Project Tasks  
- Data Cleaning: Removing unnecessary columns, handling missing values, and preparing the dataset.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing accident trends by city, hour, weekday, and weather condition.  
- Temperature Analysis: Exploring temperature distribution during accidents.  
- Geographical Visualization: Mapping accident hotspots using a Folium HeatMap.

## How to Run  
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Ensure all required libraries are installed (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `folium`).  
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`PRODIGY_DS_05.ipynb`).  
4. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to perform data cleaning, EDA, and visualization.

## Key Insights  
- **Los Angeles**, **Houston**, and **Charlotte** had the highest number of reported accidents.  
- Most accidents occur during **morning and evening rush hours**.  
- Accident rates peak on **Fridays**.  
- Accidents most frequently happen in **clear, overcast, and rainy** weather.  
- The majority of accidents occurred at temperatures between **50Â°F and 80Â°F**.  
- Interactive heatmap highlighted key accident hotspots across the US.

These insights offer valuable information for traffic management authorities and public safety initiatives to reduce accident risks.
